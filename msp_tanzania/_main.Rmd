# Executive summary {-}
Open, reproducible, and collaborative science requires the development of tools that can analyze, visualize, and update data. Interactive based tools have the potential to transform the way scientific results are communicated, giving the audience more control over the exploration of data inputs and outputs, thus permitting an engaged and detailed exploration of patterns otherwise obscured by traditional static approaches (e.g., figures, tables, and reports). In the DFO Science community, R (R Core Team 2019) has become one of the most popular programming languages used for statistical computing, graphics and automated generation of scientific reports. Available packages for building interactive visualizations in R (e.g., flexdashboard, shiny, and plotly) have provided the ability to move towards more open data products and reporting. These proceedings summarize a series of R Learning and Development workshops on the use of interactive tools for science advice hosted by the Fisheries and Ocean Canada (DFO) Science Sector (Maritimes Region) in Fall 2019. These workshops enabled Science staff to share and learn about the application of interactive tools and their role in supporting a more open approach for science communication and advice. It is hoped that discussions from these workshops will initiate a path-forward to extend interactive tools to other approaches at DFO. These proceedings provide an overall summary of this R Learning and Development series, describing the materials, presentations, questions, discussions, and ultimately recommendations on how to continue exploring tools to improve science communication and advice.

# Introduction

Open, reproducible, and collaborative science at DFO involves the development of tools to analyze, visualize, and update data in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Increasingly, advice provision and ocean management requires the integration and analysis of large and diverse data sets, with outputs being used to inform decision-making processes such as stock assessment, ecosystem approaches to fisheries management, conservation planning, and marine spatial planning. Efforts are underway to develop tools for transparent, traceable, and transferable assessments at DFO (Edwards et al. 2018), which combined with interactive spatial tools, demonstrate a new and powerful approach for science communication and advice (Regular et al. submitted). 

Interactive tools allow the audience to interact with data and data products, allowing increased control over what type of information the user wants to explore in more detail over traditional static outputs (e.g., tables, figures, reports). For instance, Gomez et al. (2016) used an interactive interface (published as a supplement: https://catalinagomez.shinyapps.io/BRSApp/) that allowed users to review and manipulate information gathered on the behavioural responses of wild marine mammals to noise, and the disparity between science and policy. This interactive tool allows readers to download, filter, and re-plot the data in a variety of ways to further explore and understand this work in a more open and transparent manner. Interactive tools offer a tangible step towards more open-data science and regulatory advice, and have recently been developed within DFO to enrich scientific review and advisory processes such as those coordinated by the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS). For instance, in 2017 the DFO Maritimes Region developed a tool (https://incorporatingecosystemapproach.shinyapps.io/indiapp/) for an exploratory ecosystem-focused analysis that integrates information derived from oceanographic conditions and ecological indicators, together with stock indices. 

The primary aim of this project was to provide an initial exploration of how interactive tools can enrich and/or augment stock assessments, and was used for discussion at the Groundfish CSAS Update on December 4-5, 2017. Such a tool has allowed end users to actively explore data inputs and outputs, in addition to the commonly used static plots. Regular et al. (submitted) provide an example of this progress within DFO, by building interactive visualizations using new open source R packages (Flexdashboard, Shiny, and Plotly; Allaire 2017, Chang et al. 2019, and Sievert 2018, respectively) directly into stock assessment processes. Regular et al. (submitted) contend that the use of interactive visualization tools as part of the science advice process can lead to improved transparency, engagement, and communication, between all participants in the peer-review process. Another example is the open knowledge platform e-Drivers (https://david-beauchesne.shinyapps.io/edriversapp/) developed by David Beauchesne to facilitate the process of gathering experts committed to structuring, standardizing, and sharing

knowledge on drivers in support of science and management (https://david-beauchesne.shinyapps.io/edriversapp/) Recognizing the benefits and relative simplicity of developing R interactive tools, a series of R Learning and Development sessions were held to: introduce these new approaches to the broader DFO Science community; to share and learn about the use of interactive tools and their role in improving the way we explore, communicate, and provide science advice; and to kick start a network of users interested in extending these approaches to other science applications beyond stock assessment. 

These proceedings provide an overall summary of this series on the use of Interactive Tools for Science Advice hosted by DFO Science Sector – Maritimes Region, in November and December, 2019. This series of Learning and Development training consisted of three R workshop components: 

i. An introduction to R Shiny Applications, 
i. Hands-on training on Interactive Tools for Science Advice (e.g. flexdashboard R package, Allaire 2017), and 
i. Interactive tools for science advice with R dashboard. 

The first and third series were open to everyone in the DFO Maritimes Region interested in R (WebEx capabilities were available), while the second workshop was attended by a total of 28 Maritimes Region Science Staff from all Science Divisions, and one participant from the Oceans Management Program. The intent of these proceedings is to document the discussion and material from this workshop series and provide an open platform for which other interested users can download and try the learned approaches (including R code). Further, we propose recommendations on how to move forward with these types of novel approaches that challenge traditional ways of pursuing science advice.

# Overview of R Learning and Development Series
## Foreword: Towards Climate Change Neutrality
Learning and Development is fundamental to effective networking, reporting recent findings, and implementing new tools available in the scientific realm. The DFO Maritimes Region Science Sector includes Learning and Development as part of its action plan to address the results of the 2018 Public Service Employee Survey. However, major hurdles to attaining the full benefits of Learning and Development include scheduling conflicts (missed opportunities) and an increasing carbon footprint (travel requirements). Fox et al. (2009) flagged the relatively large carbon footprint of scientists (conservation biologists) compared to both American and global averages.

Differences in per capita carbon production are primarily due to flying, in part, to participate in workshops and learning events. However, there are practical solutions to reducing carbon footprints when planning workshops and conferences (Bossdorf et al. 2009). This workshop series aimed to balance the need to keep up to date with learning and development requirements, while minimizing individual and departmental carbon footprints through the reduction of travel (i.e., air travel).

To make this R workshop series “greener”, we chose a local venue, avoided disposable tableware, did not print materials, used primarily electronic information, and invited primarily local participants based at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO). CO2 emissions from the workshop were primarily attributed to air travel of the instructor from St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador. Maritimes Region also includes St. Andrews Biological Station (SABS) in New Brunswick. In the spirit of connecting initiatives from SABS and BIO, while keeping our goal to reduce our carbon footprint, we invited one participant from SABS in order to facilitate information transfer to its facility. Further, we recorded the seminar, documented all material, posted the workshop code online, and provided two additional series of virtual workshops that were remotely accessible through Webex. Recording the workshop material and making it available to others is a pragmatic solution to promoting carbon-neutrality in Learning and Development programs that requires no additional travel.

Our approach to minimize the carbon footprint associated with these workshops, while maintaining a high standard of science technical training was deemed successful and acknowledged by participants as an important consideration in planning future workshops. Ultimately hosting workshop materials online will help to improve individual and departmental workflow(s) essential to learning, teamwork, and career development.
Format.

This series of R Learning and Development training on using interactive tools for science advice consisted of three components: i) an introduction on Shiny Applications: lunch and learn session, ii) a full-day hands-on workshop entitled ‘Interactive Tools for Science Advice’ followed by an open seminar delivered by Paul Regular (DFO Science, NFLD Region), and iii) an Interactive Tools for Science Advice dashboard: lunch and learn session (Table 1).
All material and code from these sessions is publically accessible through a repository for material related to regularly held R workshops at BIO: https://github.com/AtlanticR/bioRworkshops/. Specific details of each component are described in the following sections.

# Parts

You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. 

Add a numbered part: `# (PART) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an unnumbered part: `# (PART\*) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: `# (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

# Footnotes and citations 

## Footnotes

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`. Like this one ^[This is a footnote.]. 

## Citations

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`.

For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). 
Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.


The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>
