# Overview of R Learning and Development Series
## Foreword: Towards Climate Change Neutrality
Learning and Development is fundamental to effective networking, reporting recent findings, and implementing new tools available in the scientific realm. The DFO Maritimes Region Science Sector includes Learning and Development as part of its action plan to address the results of the 2018 Public Service Employee Survey. However, major hurdles to attaining the full benefits of Learning and Development include scheduling conflicts (missed opportunities) and an increasing carbon footprint (travel requirements). Fox et al. (2009) flagged the relatively large carbon footprint of scientists (conservation biologists) compared to both American and global averages.

Differences in per capita carbon production are primarily due to flying, in part, to participate in workshops and learning events. However, there are practical solutions to reducing carbon footprints when planning workshops and conferences (Bossdorf et al. 2009). This workshop series aimed to balance the need to keep up to date with learning and development requirements, while minimizing individual and departmental carbon footprints through the reduction of travel (i.e., air travel).

To make this R workshop series “greener”, we chose a local venue, avoided disposable tableware, did not print materials, used primarily electronic information, and invited primarily local participants based at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO). CO2 emissions from the workshop were primarily attributed to air travel of the instructor from St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador. Maritimes Region also includes St. Andrews Biological Station (SABS) in New Brunswick. In the spirit of connecting initiatives from SABS and BIO, while keeping our goal to reduce our carbon footprint, we invited one participant from SABS in order to facilitate information transfer to its facility. Further, we recorded the seminar, documented all material, posted the workshop code online, and provided two additional series of virtual workshops that were remotely accessible through Webex. Recording the workshop material and making it available to others is a pragmatic solution to promoting carbon-neutrality in Learning and Development programs that requires no additional travel.

Our approach to minimize the carbon footprint associated with these workshops, while maintaining a high standard of science technical training was deemed successful and acknowledged by participants as an important consideration in planning future workshops. Ultimately hosting workshop materials online will help to improve individual and departmental workflow(s) essential to learning, teamwork, and career development.
Format.

This series of R Learning and Development training on using interactive tools for science advice consisted of three components: i) an introduction on Shiny Applications: lunch and learn session, ii) a full-day hands-on workshop entitled ‘Interactive Tools for Science Advice’ followed by an open seminar delivered by Paul Regular (DFO Science, NFLD Region), and iii) an Interactive Tools for Science Advice dashboard: lunch and learn session (Table 1).
All material and code from these sessions is publically accessible through a repository for material related to regularly held R workshops at BIO: https://github.com/AtlanticR/bioRworkshops/. Specific details of each component are described in the following sections.
